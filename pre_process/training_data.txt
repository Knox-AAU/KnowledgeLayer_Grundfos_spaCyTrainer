liquid transfer in tanks irrigation systems.
2.1 Well preparation.
If SQ/SQE is to be installed in a new well, the well should be fully developed and bailed or blown free of cuttings and sand.
The construction of the Grundfos SQ/SQE submersibles makes them resistant to abrasion; however, no pump made of any material can forever withstand the destructive wear that occurs when constantly pumping sandy water.
If SQ/SQE is used to replace an oil-filled submersible or oil-lubricated line-shaft turbine in an existing well, the well must be blown or bailed clear of oil.
2.2 Make sure you have the right pump.
Determine the maximum depth of the well and the drawdown level at the maximum pump capacity.
Pump selection and setting depth should be made based on this data.
2.3 Pumped liquid requirements.
Submersible well pumps are designed for pumping clear, cold water; free of air or gases.
Decreased pump performance and life expectancy can occur if the water is not clear, cold or contains air or gases.
A check should be made to ensure that the installation depth of SQ/SQE will always be at least three feet below the maximum drawdown level of the well.
The bottom of the motor should never be installed lower than the top of the well screen or within five feet of the well bottom.
CAUTION: SQ/SQE has been approved for pumping maximum 86°F water only.
2.4 Liquid temperatures/cooling.
Figure 1 shows an SQ/SQE pump installed in a well.
With SQ/SQE operating, figure 1 illustrates the following: • Well diameter • Pump diameter • Temperature of pumped liquid • Flow past the motor to SQ/SQE suction strainer.
Note: The well diameter must be at least 3 inches.
If there is a risk that the motor will be covered with sediment, it is recommended SQ/SQE be placed in a flow sleeve.
The motor should always be installed above the well screen.
Injecting motor liquid 3.1 Positional requirements.
SQ/SQE is suitable for vertical as well as horizontal installation, however, SQ/SQE shaft must never fall below the horizontal plane, see fig.

If SQ/SQE is to be installed horizontally, e.g.
in a tank, and there is a risk that SQ/SQE might be covered by mud, it must be installed in a flow sleeve.

Grundfos MS 3 and MSE 3 submersible motors have water-lubricated slide bearings.
No additional lubrication is required.
The submersible motors are factory-filled with a special Grundfos motor liquid, type SML 2 or SML 3, which will protect the motor liquid down to 4°F (–20°C) and prevent the growth of bacteria.
The level of motor liquid is important for the operating life of the bearings and consequently the life of the motor.
2.6 Refilling of motor liquid.
If for any reason the motor liquid has been drained or lost, the motor must be refilled with Grundfos motor liquid SML 2 or SML 3.
To refill the motor, proceed as follows: 1.
Remove the cable guard and separate SQ/SQE end from the motor.

Place the motor in vertical position with an inclination of approximately 10°.

Remove the filling plug using a screwdriver or a 4.
similar tool.
Inject motor liquid into the motor with a filling syringe or similar tool, see fig.


To allow possible air to escape, move the motor from side to side and turn the shaft.

Replace the filling plug and make sure it is tight.

Assemble pump end and motor.

Fit the cable guard.
SQ/SQE is now ready for installation.

5 4.1 General.
The electrical connection should be carried out by an authorized electrician in accordance with local regulations.
WARNING:.
Before starting work on the pump, make sure that the electricity supply has been switched off and that it cannot be accidentally switched on.
SQ/SQE is permanent wiring connection only.
Reduced risk of electric shock during operation of SQ/SQE requires the provision of acceptable grounding.
The grounding connection must be made by a copper conductor, at least the size of the circuit conductors supplying SQ/SQE.
SQ/SQE must be connected to an external mains switch.
SQ/SQE must never be connected to a capacitor or to another type of control box than CU 300 or CU 301.
SQ/SQE must never be connected to an external frequency converter.
The supply voltage, rated maximum current and power factor (PF) appear on the motor nameplate.
The required voltage for Grundfos submersible MS 3 and MSE 3 motors, measured at the motor terminals, is –10%/+6% of the nominal voltage during continuous operation (including variation in the supply voltage and losses in cables).
If SQ/SQE is connected to an installation where a Ground Fault circuit breaker (GFI) is used as additional protection, this circuit breaker must trip out when ground fault currents with DC content (pulsating DC) occur.
Supply voltage.
1 x 100-115 V or 1 x 200-240 V, 50/60 Hz.
The current consumption can only be measured accurately by means of a true RMS instrument.
If other instruments are used, the value measured will differ from the actual value.
The SQE pumps can be connected to a CU 300 or CU 301 control box.
4.2 Motor protection.
The motor has built-in automatic thermal overload protection and requires no additional motor protection.
4.3 Connection of motor.
The motor can be connected directly to the main circuit breaker.
Start/stop of SQ/SQE will typically be done via a pressure switch, see figs.
4 and 5.
Note: The pressure switch must be rated for the.
maximum amps of the specific pump.

Splicing the cable.
Splice the drop cable with the motor cable.
The splice must be made carefully.
It is recommended to use a third-party-approved watertight junction box or splice connection.

Fitting the cable guard.
To fit the cable guard, proceed as follows: 1.
Make sure that the motor lead lies flat in the cable guard.

Place the cable guard in the groove in the cable plug.
The two flaps must engage with the upper edge of SQ/SQE sleeve, see fig.

Piping.
• SQ/SQE should only be gripped by the two flats at the top of the pump, see fig.

• SQ/SQE can be installed vertically or horizontally.
During operation, SQ/SQE must always be completely submerged in water.
• When plastic pipe is used, a stainless-steel safety wire is recommended for lowering and lifting SQ/SQE.
Fasten the wire to the eyelet on the pump, see fig.

• The threaded joints must be well cut and fit together tightly to ensure that they do not work loose.

6 Placing the cable guard.

Fasten the cable guard to SQ/SQE suction strainer with the two self-tapping screws supplied, see fig.


7 9.1 Installation depth.
The dynamic water level should always be above the pump, see fig.

A = Dynamic water level B = Static water level C = Minimum 3 inch well diameter D = Drawdown E = Installation depth below static water level.
Maximum 500 feet.
Installation depth Procedure.
To install the pump, proceed as follows: 1.
Attach the enclosed data plate sticker at the well head.

Check the well for proper clearance.
The well must be at least 3 inches in diameter.
It is a good idea to check the well for clearance using a plumb ring (2.95 ø x 10 in.).

Attach the first section of riser pipe to SQ/SQE.

Lower SQ/SQE into the well.
Make sure the motor cable is not damaged when SQ/SQE is lifted or lowered into the well, especially in 3 inch wells.
Note: Do not lower or lift SQ/SQE using the.
motor cable.

When SQ/SQE has been installed to the required depth, the installation should be finished by means of a well seal.
Note that the dynamic water level should always be above SQ/SQE.

Loosen the safety wire so that it becomes unloaded and lock it to the well seal using a cable clamp.

Complete the electrical connections.
Note: SQ/SQE must never be connected to a.
capacitor or to another type of control box than CU 300 or CU 301.
Installation depths.
Maximum installation depth: 500 feet below the static water level.
Minimum installation depth: 1.75 feet below the dynamic water level.
Vertical installation.
During start-up and operation, SQ/SQE must always be completely submerged in water.
Horizontal installation.
SQ/SQE must be installed at least 1.75 feet below the dynamic water level.
If there is a risk that SQ/SQE might be covered by mud, SQ/SQE must always be placed in a flow sleeve.
Note: Do not lower or lift SQ/SQE using the motor.
cable.

Generator operation.
It is safe to operate the SQ/SQE with a generator.
The generator must be sized 50% above the P1.
(input power) values of SQ/SQE.
See the following table.

Starting SQ/SQE for the first time.
When SQ/SQE has been connected correctly, SQ/SQE should be started with the discharge valve closed approximately one third.
Due to the soft start feature, SQ/SQE takes approximately 2 seconds to develop full pressure.
11.1 Motor cooling and other considerations.
• Make sure the well is capable of yielding a minimum quantity of water corresponding to SQ/SQE capacity.
• Do not start SQ/SQE until it is completely submerged in the liquid.
• As the valve is being opened, the drawdown should be checked to ensure that SQ/SQE always remains submerged.

• To ensure the necessary cooling of the motor, SQ/SQE should never be set so low that it gives no water.
If the flow rate suddenly falls, the reason might be that SQ/SQE is pumping more water than the well can yield.
SQ/SQE must immediately be stopped and the fault corrected.
11.2 Impurities in the water.
If there are impurities in the water, the valve should be opened gradually as the water becomes clearer.
SQ/SQE should not be stopped until the water is clean, otherwise SQ/SQE parts and the check valve may become clogged.
When the water is clean, the valve should be fully opened.
11.3 Minimum flow rate.
To ensure the necessary cooling of the motor, SQ/SQE flow rate should never be set to a value lower than 0.2 gpm.
If the flow rate suddenly falls, the reason might be that SQ/SQE is pumping more water than the well can yield.
SQ/SQE must immediately be stopped and the fault corrected.
WARNING: The pump's dry-running protection is.
effective only within the recommended duty range of SQ/SQE.
Note: Do not let SQ/SQE run against a closed dis.
charge valve for more than 5 minutes.
When the discharge valve is closed, there is no cooling flow and there is a risk of overheating in motor and pump.
11.4 Built-in functions.
The motor incorporates an electronic unit which functions as follows: • In case of overload, the built-in overload protection will stop SQ/SQE for 5 minutes.
After that period, SQ/SQE will attempt to restart.
If SQ/SQE has been stopped as a result of dry running, it will start automatically after 5 minutes.
If SQ/SQE is restarted and the well has not recovered, SQ/SQE will stop after 30 seconds.
• • 11.5 Resetting SQ/SQE.
Switch off the electricity supply for 1 minute.
Note: All MS 3 motors are factory-set to detect dry.
running conditions.
Check that the combination of pump and motor corresponds to the data on page 35.
Note: All MSE 3 motors are factory-set to detect dry.
running conditions.
However, if the maximum pump speed setting is changed, the dry-running stop value must also be changed.
Please refer to either the CU 300 or CU 301 I&O for instructions on this procedure.
11.8 Maintenance and service.
The pumps are normally maintenance-free.
Deposits and wear may occur.
For that purpose, service kits and service tools are available from Grundfos.
The pumps can be serviced at a Grundfos service center.

Assembly of pump and motor.
To assemble pump end and motor, proceed as follows: 1.
Place the motor horizontally in a vice and tighten it, see fig.


Pull SQ/SQE shaft out to the position shown in fig.


10 Pump shaft position.

Grease the motor shaft end with the grease supplied with the motor.

Screw SQ/SQE end on the motor (55 Nm).
